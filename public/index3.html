    <h2 class="fancy">D</h2>o not be alarmed, dear friend, for this is merely a test. That is to say that we are only
    testing this and
    not
    actually doing it. Therefore, there is absolutely no cause for concern of any kind. We could just as easily be
    doing
    the actual thing now if we so wished, for that would be just as easy as conducting a test. But we're not. And of
    course if we were attempting it for real, we would be certain to do so properly and not in such an experimental
    manner. For the real thing is serious and should not be taken so lightly, as it may be confused with being just
    a
    test, and that could be dangerous. But alas, this is not real, for it is only a test.</p>
    <p>You, as a person who may or may not within his or her daily life encounter a test (not unlike the aforementioned
        and currently-ongoing test previously mention above), may hear alternative terms used to reference a test. The
        use
        of these unfamiliar words may evoke a sense that something is indeed actually going to happen soon. However, it
        would be wise to remember that a test by any other name is still a test. A non-exhaustive list of test synonyms
        includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trial</li>
        <li>Trial run</li>
        <li>Drill</li>
        <li>Practice run</li>
        <li>Dry run</li>
        <li>Experiment</li>
        <li>Assessment</li>
        <li>Inspection</li>
        <li>Evaluation</li>
        <li>Check</li>
        <li>Tryout</li>
        <li>Inquest</li>
    </ul>
