INTRODUCTION</h5>\n    <br />\n    <p>The following is loosely inspired by true events:</p>\n    <p>\n      Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, on a dark and stormy night in\n      my younger and more vulnerable years, it was the best of times, it was the\n      worst of times, and it was love at first sight from the moment I first\n      laid eyes upon these Website Standard Terms and Conditions.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      These Terms will be applied fully and affect your use of this Website. By\n      using this Website, you agreed to accept all terms and conditions written\n      in here, unconditionally, without question, under pain of death. You must\n      not use this Website if you disagree with any of these Website Standard\n      Terms and Conditions, are prone to cheating on tests, or cannot\n      participate in a blood oath due to anemia, hemophilia, AIDS or another\n      condition, either medical or otherwise.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Robots or people below 3 years of age are not allowed to use this Website.\n      And terrorists. And also accountants, because we just don’t like you. So\n      robots, people below 3 years of age, terrorists, and accountants are not\n      allowed to use this Website. Oh, and restaurant employees who don’t wash\n      their hands before returning to work like the signs say, because that’s\n      just gross!\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <h5>II. DEFINITIONS</h5>\n    <br />\n    <p>For the purpose of these Terms and Conditions:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>\"Service\"</strong> refers to the Website and all of its content\n        and materials contained within\n      </li>{\" \"}\n      <li>\n        <strong>“Site”</strong> is a shortened version of “Website”\n      </li>{\" \"}\n      <li>\n        <strong>“User”</strong> means any individuals or entities viewing any\n        part of this Website. It could also mean a person engaged in the\n        excessive use of addictive substances, either illicit or otherwise, but\n        that’s a different type of user and not what we mean here.\n      </li>{\" \"}\n      <li>\n        <strong>“Website”</strong> means the site as a whole and is capitalized\n        because it looks more pretentious that way\n      </li>{\" \"}\n      <li>\n        <strong>“Terms”</strong> is another word for “Conditions” (see{\" \"}\n        <em>“Conditions”</em>)\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>“The Test”</strong> refers to the test, duh\n      </li>{\" \"}\n      <li>\n        <strong>“Robot”</strong> means a machine resembling a human which is not\n        welcome here\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>“Conditions”</strong> is just a synonym for “Terms” (refer to\n        <em>“Terms”</em>)\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>“Malapropism”</strong> means the mistaken use of a word in place\n        of a similar-sounding one, often unintentionally. This word isn’t used\n        here, but we thought you should know what it means anyway.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <br />\n    <h5>III. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h5>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      Under these Terms, The Test and/or its licensors own all the intellectual\n      property rights and materials contained in this Website, except for things\n      we stole from other sources.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You are granted limited license only for purposes of viewing the material\n      contained on this Website and “Rolling on the Floor Laughing” afterwards,\n      as the kiddos are saying nowadays.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <h5>IV.

You cannot hide. Resistance is futile.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This is solely for your benefit and to prepare you for the future, where\n      robots and corporations have taken over and people live in a dark, grungy,\n      neon-lit, cyberpunk dystopia where all buildings look the same and\n      everyone wears shiny, latex, single-color jumpsuits and uses some sort of\n      primitive, retro-futuristic version of 1980s technology even though it’s\n      supposed to be the future and eats some cheap Japanese knockoff version of\n      Ramen noodles and “food paste” at every meal and spends all day toiling\n      away for their corporate overlords with no rights or privacy or quality of\n      life whatsoever.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <h5>VI.
