INTRODUCTION</h5>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <p>The following is loosely inspired by true events:</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, on a dark and stormy night in\r\n      my younger and more vulnerable years, it was the best of times, it was the\r\n      worst of times, and it was love at first sight from the moment I first\r\n      laid eyes upon these Website Standard Terms and Conditions.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      These Terms will be applied fully and affect your use of this Website. By\r\n      using this Website, you agreed to accept all terms and conditions written\r\n      in here, unconditionally, without question, under pain of death. You must\r\n      not use this Website if you disagree with any of these Website Standard\r\n      Terms and Conditions, are prone to cheating on tests, or cannot\r\n      participate in a blood oath due to anemia, hemophilia, AIDS or another\r\n      condition, either medical or otherwise.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Robots or people below 3 years of age are not allowed to use this Website.\r\n      And terrorists. And also accountants, because we just don’t like you. So\r\n      robots, people below 3 years of age, terrorists, and accountants are not\r\n      allowed to use this Website. Oh, and restaurant employees who don’t wash\r\n      their hands before returning to work like the signs say, because that’s\r\n      just gross!\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <h5>II.
