    <h5>I. INTRODUCTION</h5>
    <br />
    <p>The following is loosely inspired by true events:</p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, on a dark and stormy night in
      my younger and more vulnerable years, it was the best of times, it was the
      worst of times, and it was love at first sight from the moment I first
      laid eyes upon these Website Standard Terms and Conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms will be applied fully and affect your use of this Website. By
      using this Website, you agreed to accept all terms and conditions written
      in here, unconditionally, without question, under pain of death. You must
      not use this Website if you disagree with any of these Website Standard
      Terms and Conditions, are prone to cheating on tests, or cannot
      participate in a blood oath due to anemia, hemophilia, AIDS or another
      condition, either medical or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robots or people below 3 years of age are not allowed to use this Website.
      And terrorists. And also accountants, because we just don’t like you. So
      robots, people below 3 years of age, terrorists, and accountants are not
      allowed to use this Website. Oh, and restaurant employees who don’t wash
      their hands before returning to work like the signs say, because that’s
      just gross!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5>II. DEFINITIONS</h5>
    <br />
    <p>For the purpose of these Terms and Conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>"Service"</strong> refers to the Website and all of its content
        and materials contained within
      </li>{" "}
      <li>
        <strong>“Site”</strong> is a shortened version of “Website”
      </li>{" "}
      <li>
        <strong>“User”</strong> means any individuals or entities viewing any
        part of this Website. It could also mean a person engaged in the
        excessive use of addictive substances, either illicit or otherwise, but
        that’s a different type of user and not what we mean here.
      </li>{" "}
      <li>
        <strong>“Website”</strong> means the site as a whole and is capitalized
        because it looks more pretentious that way
      </li>{" "}
      <li>
        <strong>“Terms”</strong> is another word for “Conditions” (see{" "}
        <em>“Conditions”</em>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“The Test”</strong> refers to the test, duh
      </li>{" "}
      <li>
        <strong>“Robot”</strong> means a machine resembling a human which is not
        welcome here
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“Conditions”</strong> is just a synonym for “Terms” (refer to
        <em>“Terms”</em>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“Malapropism”</strong> means the mistaken use of a word in place
        of a similar-sounding one, often unintentionally. This word isn’t used
        here, but we thought you should know what it means anyway.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h5>III. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h5>
    <br />
    <p>

    <p>

      <li>Using this Website for personal gain.</li>
    </ul>{" "}
    <p>
      Certain areas of this Website have been deemed too good for you and are
      therefore restricted from being accessed by you. We may further restrict
      access by you to any areas of this Website, at any time, in absolute
      discretion for any reason or no reason whatsoever other than our own
      sadistic pleasure.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5>V. YOUR "PRIVACY"</h5> <br />
    <p>
      We hereby revoke any and all semblance of privacy from you, the “User”
      while using  this Website. We are watching you. You are not alone. We have
      eyes and ears everywhere. Not even your thoughts are safe. For example, we
      know you were just thinking about crime a minute ago, and next you’re
      going to be picturing a chimpanzee wearing a pink tutu while eating a
      banana. Aha! See? You cannot hide. Resistance is futile.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is solely for your benefit and to prepare you for the future, where
      robots and corporations have taken over and people live in a dark, grungy,
      neon-lit, cyberpunk dystopia where all buildings look the same and
      everyone wears shiny, latex, single-color jumpsuits and uses some sort of
      primitive, retro-futuristic version of 1980s technology even though it’s
      supposed to be the future and eats some cheap Japanese knockoff version of
      Ramen noodles and “food paste” at every meal and spends all day toiling
      away for their corporate overlords with no rights or privacy or quality of
      life whatsoever.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5>VI. WARRANTIES</h5>
    <br />
    <p>
      This Website is provided "as is," with all faults, and we offer no
      representations or warranties of any kind related to this Website or the
      materials contained on this Website. I mean come on, man, it’s a website.
      Why would there be a warranty?
    </p>
    <p>
      DISCLAIMER: THIS WEBSITE DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE and is not
      intended as a substitute for professional medical care, nor are any of our
      staff licensed medical practitioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Our legal team made us put that in there after we gave a guy some advice
      to help with his digestive issues. Turns out drinking mercury is not an
      effective treatment for constipation.)

    <h5>VII. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5>
    <br />

    </p>
    <br />
    <h5>VIII. INDEMNIFICATION</h5>
    <br />
    <p>
      You hereby indemnify to the fullest extent this Website from and against
      blah blah blah yatta yatta yatta whatever. I wonder what I should make for
      dinner tonight. Maybe some chicken and rice? Ooh or maybe some spaghetti!
      Or how about I just order a pizza? Yeah that sounds good. I don’t really
      feel like cooking anyway.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5>IX. SEVERABILITY</h5>
    <br />
    <p>Something something something who actually reads these anyway.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>X. VARIATION OF TERMS</h5>
